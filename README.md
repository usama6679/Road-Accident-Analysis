# Road-Accident-Analysis

This project is a visualization of road accidents in the United Kingdom using Power BI. The data used in this visualization is sourced from the UK government's road safety data portal. The aim of this project is to provide an interactive and visually engaging way of exploring road accident data in the UK.

The visualization provides a variety of filters and slicers that allow users to narrow down the data based on various criteria such as accident severity, weather conditions, and location. Users can also explore the data using various charts and graphs, including bar charts, area charts,donut chart, and maps.

This project is designed to be accessible to a wide range of users, including researchers, policymakers, and the general public. It provides a comprehensive view of road accidents in the UK, and can help identify trends and patterns that may inform road safety initiatives.

To use this visualization, simply download the Power BI file and open it in Power BI Desktop. From there, you can explore the data using the various filters and slicers, as well as interact with the charts and graphs to gain insights into road accident data in the UK.
